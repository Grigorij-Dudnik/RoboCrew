## Quick Start

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Install RoboCrew:</p>

```bash
pip install robocrew
```
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>If you want to use voice commands, also run <code>sudo apt install portaudio19-dev</code> to install Portaudio for audio support.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>(Optional but recommended) Set up <strong>udev rules</strong> for consistent device naming by following the <a href="../setup/udev-rules">udev rules guide</a>, or run the automatic setup script:</p>

```bash
robocrew-setup-usb-modules
```
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Run the example code below to see your robot in action. Make sure to provide the correct USB ports for your robot's main camera and arm connected to wheels.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

### Example script

```python
from robocrew.core.LLMAgent import LLMAgent
from robocrew.core.tools import finish_task
from robocrew.robots.XLeRobot.tools import create_move_forward, create_turn_left, create_turn_right
from robocrew.robots.XLeRobot.wheel_controls import XLeRobotWheels

# Set up wheels
sdk = XLeRobotWheels.connect_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0")     # provide the right arm usb port - the arm connected to wheels
wheel_controller = XLeRobotWheels(sdk)

# Create movement tools
move_forward = create_move_forward(wheel_controller)
turn_left = create_turn_left(wheel_controller)
turn_right = create_turn_right(wheel_controller)

# Create agent
agent = LLMAgent(
    model="google_genai:gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview",
    tools=[move_forward, turn_left, turn_right, finish_task],
    main_camera_usb_port="/dev/video0",  # provide usb port main camera connected to
)
agent.task = "Find kitchen in my house and go there."

agent.go()  # Robot explores autonomously
```
